This device will upload to your project and then electrically disconnect itself.

By electronically disconnecting from your target project after it uploads your program, this device allows you to make full use of the 2 pins assinged to the bootloader's TX and RX pins without having to physically disconnect from it.

It also has an optional current limit when feeding 5 volts to the target project.  This can protect both the USB feed and your target project.

Provisions are available to make very low current measurements when testing the sleep or other power saving modes of operation.
